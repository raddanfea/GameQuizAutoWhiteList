# Google Form To Whitelist
This is a python script that automatically adds players to your 
game server whitelist based on the CVS file generated by a Google Forms quiz.

Written by me, for a DayZ roleplaying gameserver, so the default formatting style is 'GUID Nickname'

It reads the CSV file from a link, determines who succeeded and if the list changed, uploads it to the FTP server. 

* Can be modified for other games and to add  more conditions easily.
* If you have trouble running this under linux, use dos2unix.
